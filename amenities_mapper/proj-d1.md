## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 
 
You all have great ideas. My recommendation based on the amount of time left in the course will be to choose the project that you have the most data to collect. This will allow you to perform your analysis much easier. I would go with either of the following options: 

- Neighborhood quality of life
- Analysis of COVID Resources
